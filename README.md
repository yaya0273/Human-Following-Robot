# Human-Following-Robot

Components Required:-
1) Arduino Board & IDE
2) Ultrasonic Sensor
3) 2 x IR Sensors
4) 2 x DC Motor
5) Motor Driver
6) 2 x 9V Batteries
7) Robot Mettalic Frame

How it works:-
The ultrasonic sensor determines the distance to the object in front of the robot. If the distance is between 10 and 30 cms it will move forward.
There are 2 IR sensors present on both sides. When an object is located to either side, the robot will turn towards that side.
